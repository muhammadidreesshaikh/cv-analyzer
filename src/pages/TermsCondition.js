                                <h6>Cv Analyzer Terms and Conditions</h6>
                                <p>Welcome, and thanks for using CvAnalyzer jobs posting platform and related products and services (the “Jobs Services”). You agree that by purchasing, signing up for, or otherwise using the Jobs Services, you are entering into a legal binding agreement (even if you are using Jobs Services on behalf of a company). The Jobs Services allow your postings to be served on properties of CvAnalyzer and enabled third parties (collectively, "Properties"), e.g., websites and mobile applications. The Jobs Services allow postings to be targeted to CvAnalyzer members based on non-personally identifiable criteria (e.g., company, industry, job function, and hashed email).</p>

                                <h6>Agreement</h6>
                                <p>In addition to the <span>CvAnalyzer User Agreement</span>, <span>Privacy Policy</span> and <span>Refund Policy</span>, these Jobs Terms and Conditions apply to the access and use of the Jobs Services. Additional terms may apply to specific features of the Jobs Services, and such terms will be presented when you engage with such features. To the extent of any conflict between different agreements that you have with LinkedIn, these Jobs Terms and Conditions and any feature-specific terms govern with respect to the use of the Jobs Services. If you are accessing or using the Jobs Services on behalf of a business or third party, you represent and warrant that you have the authority to do so and to bind that business or third party to these Jobs Terms and Conditions, and your agreement to these Jobs Terms and Conditions will be treated as their respective agreement. In this event, LinkedIn may hold you responsible for violations of this agreement by that business or third party, and "you," "your" and "party" will also refer and apply to that business or third party.</p>

                                <h6>Fees, Payment and Cancellation</h6>
                                <p>You may be offered more than one billing option when you purchase Jobs Services. You agree to pay on the basis and at the rate selected when a Posting, order, or other purchase of Jobs Services was submitted through your account ("Rate"). You also agree to pay all applicable taxes, government charges and foreign exchange fees. CvAnalyzer will periodically charge your payment method at the applicable Rate. All amounts paid are non-refundable. You remain responsible for any uncollected amounts. CvAnalyzer may charge interest for any overdue amounts at the rate of the lesser of 1% per month or the lawful maximum, and you agree to reimburse us for all collection costs for overdue amounts. For non-flat Rates (e.g., Sponsored Jobs), the amount owed will be calculated based on CvAnalyzer tracking mechanisms. CvAnalyzer is not responsible for click fraud, technological issues or other potentially invalid activity by third parties that may affect the cost of running Postings. Your exclusive remedy for suspected invalid activity is to make a claim for a Jobs Services credit within 90 days of the date of that activity, and CvAnalyzer exclusive liability is in CvAnalyzer sole discretion, to issue Jobs Services credit for suspected invalid activity. Any Jobs Services credits that you may accrue are non-refundable and non-transferable and must be used prior to termination of these Jobs Terms and Conditions or your account. </p>
                                <p>Unless you change or remove your payment method, CvAnalyzer may store and update (e.g., upon expiration) your payment method for use with subsequent campaigns, orders and purchases submitted through your account.</p>

                                <h6>Intellectual Property Rights and Privacy</h6>
                                <p>You grant to CvAnalyzer a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free, sublicensable and transferable license to use, copy, modify, distribute and publish your Postings in connection with the performance of the Jobs Services (including for marketing and promotional purposes). You represent and warrant that you own or have all necessary rights (including intellectual property rights) to your Postings (including to grant the license above). If you choose to provide suggestions or feedback to CvAnalyzer about Jobs Services, you agree that CvAnalyzer can (but does not have to) use and share such feedback for any purpose without compensation to you. You may not disclose any information about CvAnalyzer pricing, metrics, member demographics or beta features. CvAnalyzer reserves all of its intellectual property rights in the Jobs Services as further described in the User Agreement.</p>
                                <p>Each party will comply with applicable laws, self-regulatory rules, industry rules and governmental requirements (collectively, "Applicable Law") relating to its performance of these terms, including privacy and security laws (e.g., the EU Data Protection Directive 95/46/EC and EU Directive 2002/58/EC, each as amended and implemented in various EU countries). Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, each party will prominently post a complete and accurate privacy policy on its websites and in its mobile applications.</p>
                                <p>You may use information resulting from the Jobs Services ("Jobs Services Data") only on an aggregate and anonymous basis to assess the performance and effectiveness of your candidate search using the Jobs Services and to optimize your candidate search. You agree to use reasonable measures to protect the confidentiality of Jobs Services Data and to use appropriate security safeguards to protect Jobs Services Data in accordance with industry standards. You may share Jobs Services Data only with someone acting on your behalf, provided that you are responsible for ensuring their respective compliance with the Agreement and for limiting their respective use of the Jobs Services Data on your behalf. Without limiting the foregoing, you shall not (i) sell the Jobs Services Data; (ii) combine the Jobs Services Data with any data obtained by or on behalf of another employer; or (iii) except for use solely on your own behalf in a manner that does not identify the Jobs Services Data as associated with CvAnalyzer, transfer any Jobs Services Data (including anonymous, aggregate, or derived data) to any job search service, job postings board, data broker or other monetization related service.</p>
